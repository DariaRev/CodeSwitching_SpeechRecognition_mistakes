# Linguistic Background in Speech Recognition
### Codeswitching research

This research aims to investigate mistakes that speech recognition models make when trying to interpret codeswitching. The repository provides [code for parsing data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1EucXi0fVu9fmU-8wshE9zX602lMrtgdo?usp=sharing), [part of data from synthesizing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-3iuYHO0m1BjzIiG8hByGnxMJVe-Z6Yr?usp=sharing), [alignment and analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tgkUkdIbZrmLKnzazf8jqVqPj31XWCGf?usp=sharing).

## What is codeswitching for us and what do we want to do with it?
In this article we consider that people who use code switching are not only bilinguals. Since we want to focus on Russian-speaking community, we are going to explore code-switching in terms of its application in Russia. There are variety of spheres where Russian-speaking people use Russian-English codeswitching. We will look at the most famous sphere - IT. People there use transition from one language to another even if their English is not C1 or upper. That means that 1) it creates some Anglicisms and versions of Runglish, 2) codeswitching is not an ability of only bilinguals or those who know English well. So, for us codeswitching is (DEFINITION)

Second thing we need to keep in mind is that codeswitching **can be different**. It depends on many sociolinguisti—Å, territorial and condition factors. There are two types of codeswitching that people use - intersententional (between sentences) and intrasententional (inside one sentence). There are different researches about intersententional codeswitching, many about russianand english language, but there are not as many for intrasententional. It is still a big problem to recognize it when it is inside a sentence. Here we try to understand how well computer can recognize code switching, especially intrasententional and what mistakes it makes.
